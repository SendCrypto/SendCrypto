Good morning! 
It's still early in the world of web3, where even simple tasks like sending money to someone can be a daunting challenge for a newcomer to the tech.

SendCrypto makes this easier.

In the web2 world, if you want to provide lots of private data to a centralized and sometimes censoring private business,
you can go to PayPal and set up a PayPal.me link of the form PayPal.me/YourName/25 where the optional number at the end is the amount of the payment.

SendCrypto is the web3 equivalent of that, bringing the benefits of decentralization and access to cryptocurrency.
