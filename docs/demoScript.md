Good morning! 
It's still early in the world of web3, where even simple tasks like sending money to someone can be a daunting challenge for a newcomer to the tech.

SendCrypto makes this easier.

In the web2 world, if you want to provide lots of private data to a centralized and sometimes censoring private business,
you can go to PayPal and set up a PayPal.me link of the form PayPal.me/YourName/25 where the optional number at the end is the amount of the payment.  
You can then share this link with others who can click on it and after further confirming details with PayPal, send their money to your PayPal account.  

SendCrypto is the web3 equivalent of that, bringing the benefits of decentralization and access to cryptocurrency.
