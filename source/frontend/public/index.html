	<h3>An easy way to send or request cryptocurrency payments.</h3>
	<div id="noRecipient">
		<p>
			SendCrypto makes it easy to send or request cryptocurrency payments.
			You can easily create a link to receive payments through your own page on this site,
			and share that link with people who might send you money.
		</p>
		<p>
			A link is built as follows, always excluding quotes:
			<ul>
				<li>Start with "https://".</li>
				<li>
					Follow that with your preferred base domain: "sendcrypto.money" or "sendcryptoto.me" or "sendcryptocurrencyto.me".
					(Note that you are welcome to pick differently depending on your audience).
				</li>
				<li>Follow that with a slash: "/".</li>
				<li>
					Follow that with the address or
					ENS name
					of the account that should receive the funds.
					For example: "0x46438f69ab55D8f29956b6A2B45c9b6f3Fa6332c".
				</li>
				<li>Follow that with a slash: "/".</li>
				<li>
					Optionally follow that with the type of currency you would like to specify an amount in, followed by a slash ("/").
					At present, this must be "ETH". This value will be translated to the native currency of an EVM
					chain if you specify a different one as described below.
					You will eventually be able to specify the amount in "USD" or any of the cryptocurrency tokens noted below.
					This is not case-sensitive.
					If you do not specify anything here, USD will be assumed,
					but specification is currently required (and must be "ETH") if you're going to specify the amount.
				</li>
				<li>
					Optionally include the default amount you would like to be filled in when someone arrives at this page,
					followed by a slash.
				</li>
				<li>
					Optionally include the cryptocurrency asset that should be specified by default,
					if a user has holdings in multiple supported assets.
					Currently, options are just "ETH" (referring to the default coin of whatever network may be specified),
					which is the default assumed if no value is present.
					This is not case-sensitive.
				</li>
				<li>
					If you wish to specify which network this should be sent on, at the end of the URL add "?networkID="
					followed by the numeric network ID. It must correspond to one of the chains supported by the drop-down menu
					shown on the page when all L2 and test networks are shown. The default value is 1 (for mainnet Ethereum).
				</li>
			</ul>
			Any "/" at the end of a URL (in this application) is optional.
			<br>
			For example: If you find this site useful, please <a href="/0x46438f69ab55D8f29956b6A2B45c9b6f3Fa6332c/eth/.025">click here to send your support</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			A more decentralized alternative for building the link, which can be used if your audience uses
			<a href="https://brave.com/download/" target="_blank">Brave</a> or
			<a href="https://www.opera.com/download" target="_blank">Opera</a> or the
			<a href="https://unstoppabledomains.com/extension" target="_blank">Unstoppable Domains extension</a>
			is as follows, always excluding quotes:
			<ul>
				<li>Start with "https://".</li>
				<li>
					Follow that with your preferred base domain: "quicklysend.crypto" or "sendquickly.crypto" or "sendmoneyon.blockchain" or "sendfundson.blockchain".
				</li>
				<li>Follow that with "?to=".</li>
				<li>
					Follow that with the address or
					ENS name
					of the account that should receive the funds.
					For example: "0x46438f69ab55D8f29956b6A2B45c9b6f3Fa6332c".
					You can't yet use your own Unstoppable Domain name, but that should change in the future.
				</li>
				<li>
					If you are going to specify an amount, optionally follow that with: "&viewCurrency="
					followed by the type of currency you would like to specify an amount in, which currently must be "ETH",
					which will be translated into the network native coin.
					You will eventually be able to specify the amount in "USD" or any of the cryptocurrency tokens noted below.
					This is not case-sensitive.
					If you do not specify anything here, USD will be assumed,
					but specification is currently required (and must be "ETH") if you're going to specify the amount.
				</li>
				<li>
					If you wish to specify an amount, add "&amount=" followed by the amount.
				</li>
				<li>
					If you wish to specify which network this should be sent on, add "&networkID="
					followed by the numeric network ID. It must correspond to one of the chains supported by the drop-down menu
					shown on the page when all L2 and test networks are shown. The default value is 1 (for mainnet Ethereum).
				</li>
				<li>
					If you wish to specify the cryptocurrency asset that should be specified by default,
					if a user has holdings in multiple supported assets, add "&sendCurrency=" followed by the unit.
					Currently, options are just "ETH", which is the default assumed if no value is present.
					Also note that the value "ETH" will refer to the native coin if you're specifying an EVM network
					that does not call its native coin ETH.
					This is not case-sensitive.
				</li>
			</ul>
			For example: If you find this site useful, please <a href="?to=0x46438f69ab55D8f29956b6A2B45c9b6f3Fa6332c&viewCurrency=ETH&amount=.025">click here to send your support</a>.
			<br>
			Note: This strategy of using GET parameters can also be used with traditional domains; any GET parameters will override URL parameters if both are present.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you want to convert the text link into a QR code that you can post somewhere,
			there are plenty of free sites which can do this for you (<a href="https://www.the-qrcode-generator.com/" target="_blank">one example is here</a>).
			<br>
			Best practice calls for testing the generated QR code before distribution to verify that your generator didn't change the recipient address.
			<br>
			If you are generating links programmatically, there are also open-source libraries which can convert the text links to QR codes.

			(or somehow obtain credits on whatever other network you might wish to use)
			to send funds across the network.
			<br>
			Be sure to have at least a bit more than the amount you want to send.
