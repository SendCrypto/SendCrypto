	<h3>An easy way to send or request cryptocurrency payments.</h3>
	<div id="noRecipient">
		<p>
			SendCrypto makes it easy to send or request cryptocurrency payments.
			You can easily create a link to receive payments through your own page on this site,
			and share that link with people who might send you money.
		</p>
		<p>
			A link is built as follows, always excluding quotes:
			<ul>
				<li>Start with "https://".</li>
				<li>
					Follow that with your preferred base domain: "sendcrypto.money" or "sendcryptoto.me" or "sendcryptocurrencyto.me".
					If your audience uses <a href="https://brave.com/download/" target="_blank">Brave</a> or
					<a href="https://www.opera.com/download" target="_blank">Opera</a> or the
					<a href="https://unstoppabledomains.com/extension" target="_blank">Unstoppable Domains extension</a>,
					you can also pick "quicklysend.crypto" (and you are welcome to pick differently depending on your audience).
				</li>
				<li>Follow that with a slash: "/".</li>
				<li>
					Follow that with the address or
					ENS name
					of the account that should receive the funds.
					For example: "0x46438f69ab55D8f29956b6A2B45c9b6f3Fa6332c".
				</li>
				<li>Follow that with a slash: "/".</li>
				<li>
					Optionally follow that with the type of currency you would like to specify an amount in, followed by a slash ("/").
					At present, this must be "ETH".
					You will eventually be able to specify the amount in "USD" or any of the cryptocurrency tokens noted below.
					This is not case-sensitive.
					If you do not specify anything here, USD will be assumed.
				</li>
				<li>
					Optionally include the default amount you would like to be filled in when someone arrives at this page,
					followed by a slash.
				</li>
				<li>
					Optionally include the cryptocurrency asset that should be specified by default,
					if a user has holdings in multiple supported cryptocurrencies.
					Currently, options are just "ETH". This is not case-sensitive.
				</li>
			</ul>
			Any "/" at the end of a URL (in this application) is optional.
